        <h1>What Inspires Me</h1>
        <h3>By: John King</h3>
        <h2>Colde -- Korean Musician</h2>

            The first artist I thought of to talk about it Colde. Colde is a Korean musician and 
            He inspires me because he makes his music and is very real about it. 
            He's not making music to fit in or trying to stand out, he's just expressing himself 
            and that inspires me to do the same in different ways. As well as this, the way he 
            makes music and expresses his thoughts are so visual, it doesn't feel like just music, 
            he is using sound to paint a picture which inspires me to imagine the place-setting of 
            the song.

            The next artist I would say inspires me is Nathanaël Bronn. Nathanaël Bronn is the art 
            director and character designer for the show "Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat 
            Noir". Even though I did not know who he was until I stared this assignment, he 
            inspired me through the show without me even knowing. What inspires me about his work 
            is how he managed to create characters that perfectly support their personalities and 
            responsibilities. I think it is incredible to be able to create a visual based on 
            information and roles, which is what he does.

        <p>
            The next person that has inspired me in a way is Olivia Rodrigo. She is a famous singer 
            song-writer. What inspires me about her is that she found a way to express her thoughts 
            in a very clear way, while also making them so aesthetically pleasing. I got very 
            inspired by her talent for music as well as her ability to express herself in a way 
            that was able to make a billboard list. Combining good music with expression is 
            difficult to do but she does it.
