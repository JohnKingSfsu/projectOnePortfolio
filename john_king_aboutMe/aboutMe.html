                My name is John King and I am currently a senior at San Francisco State University.
                I grew up in the Bay Area and decided to continue going to school there as well,
                This is my last semester at SFSU as a computer science major until I graduate.
                Some of my hobbies include listening to music, doing sports, and playing games.
                You could tell by the top five page, but I really enjoy listening to kpop and 
                watching videos from my favorite groups.

                I have not done sports this year yet, but
                I used to do multiple different sports and would like to start again, something like
                taekwondo. My favorite games are in the top five page as well, but I have found that any
                game with Mario in it are my favorites, the graphics are so good and the games are so
                fun. I also really enjoy learning new languages, I learned Spanish in school as well 
                as by myself, and I am currently learning Korean.

                I come from a Greek background, 
                so my favorite food is pasticho, a type of Greek food, I also really like dolmades. 
                When I was in elementary school I started drawing, and I have been interested in art
                since then. Although I do not do art as much now as then, I found website development
                to be my most fun course in the computer science major, which is why I have decided
                to take Website Design.
